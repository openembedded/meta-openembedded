SUMMARY = "An unobtrusive argparse wrapper with natural syntax"
DESCRIPTION = "Building a command-line interface? Found yourself uttering \
'argh!' while struggling with the API of argparse? Don't like the complexity \
but need the power? \
\
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. \
\
â€”Albert Einstein (probably) \
\
Argh is a smart wrapper for argparse. Argparse is a very powerful \
tool; Argh just makes it easy to use."
