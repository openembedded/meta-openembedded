Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists: drop PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS from interface

Including PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS in the INTERFACE list caused a hard-coded
Python include directory (e.g. /usr/include/python3.13) to appear in the
generated Targets.cmake file. This resulted in a CMake configuration
error when the path did not exist:

    Imported target "pybind11_json" includes non-existent path
      "/usr/include/python3.13"

pybind11_json is header-only and does not use Python headers, so the
include path should not be exported.

Upstream-Status: Submitted [https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_json/pull/77]
