Subject: [PATCH] web: Fix an open redirect in StaticFileHandler

Under some configurations the default_filename redirect could be exploited
to redirect to an attacker-controlled site. This change refuses to redirect
to URLs that could be misinterpreted.

A test case for the specific vulnerable configuration will follow after the
patch has been available.

CVE: CVE-2023-28370
Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/32ad07c54e607839273b4e1819c347f5c8976b2f]
