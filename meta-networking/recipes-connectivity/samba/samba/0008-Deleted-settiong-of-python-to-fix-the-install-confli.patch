Subject: [PATCH] Deleted settiong of python to fix the install conflict error
 when enable multilib.

  file /usr/bin/samba-tool conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba_dnsupdate conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba_downgrade_db conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba_kcc conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba_spnupdate conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686
  file /usr/sbin/samba_upgradedns conflicts between attempted installs of samba-4.14.14-r0.core2_64 and lib32-samba-4.14.14-r0.i686

The conflict is because there is a  difference between of lib32-samba-* and samba-* as the following:
64bit:
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages")

32bit:
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages")

But this setting is for environment when running from source tree. There
is no necessary on target.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate
