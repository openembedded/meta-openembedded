# restinio 0.7.x no longer bundles its third-party dependencies in the
# release tarball (unlike 0.6.x). fmt and expected-lite are resolved via
# find_package() against externally-provided packages. llhttp's upstream
# CMakeLists.txt only exports an "llhttp::llhttp_shared" imported target
# (llhttp::llhttp is merely a build-tree ALIAS, never installed/exported),
# which restinio's dev/restinio/CMakeLists.txt does not recognize as a
# valid find_package() target name, so llhttp is consumed in "system"
# mode instead (plain -lllhttp against the sysroot). The optional
# sobjectizer integration is disabled since we don't need it.
