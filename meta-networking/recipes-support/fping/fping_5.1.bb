SUMMARY = "sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts"
DESCRIPTION = "fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control \
Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is \
responding. fping differs from ping in that you can specify any number of \
targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of \
targets to ping.  Instead of sending to one target until it times out or \
replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next target \
in a round-robin fashion."
