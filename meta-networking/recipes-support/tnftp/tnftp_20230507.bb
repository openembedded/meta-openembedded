of FTP and HTTP URLs (including via proxies), command-line uploads of \
FTP URLs, context-sensitive word completion, dynamic progress bar, \
IPv6 support, modification time preservation, paging of local and \
remote files, passive mode support (with fallback to active mode), \
SOCKS support, TIS FWTK gate-ftp server support, and transfer rate \
throttling."
