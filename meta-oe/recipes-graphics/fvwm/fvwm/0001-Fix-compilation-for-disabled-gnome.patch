Subject: [PATCH] Fix compilation for Helix.

Gnome support, including GNOME_INIT_HOOK, has been removed, but it was
still being called.

COMPAT_OLD_KEYSYMDEF is a check for a legacy system, which our system
most definitely is not.  It is accomplished by trying to execute
a program, which does not work when cross compiling.

The fvwm(1) man page is created from Docbook XML which is set for
a Windows code page that is not available when compiling.  Easiest is
to just not create the man page as those are not needed on the monitor.

Upstream-Status: inappropriate [OE specific]
