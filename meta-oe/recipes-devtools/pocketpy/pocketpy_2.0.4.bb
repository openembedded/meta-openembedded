DESCRIPTION = "pkpy is a lightweight(~15K LOC) Python 3.x \
              interpreter for game scripting, written in C11. \
              It aims to be an alternative to lua for game \
              scripting, with elegant syntax, powerful features \
              and competitive performance.  pkpy is extremely \
              easy to embed via a single header file pocketpy.h, \
