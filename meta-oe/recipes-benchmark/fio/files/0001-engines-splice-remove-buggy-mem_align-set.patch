Subject: [PATCH] engines/splice: remove buggy ->mem_align set

Two things wrong here:

1) We align buffers by default, so no need for splice to do anything
   extra.
2) ->mem_align is not a true/false setting, it's the alignment itself.
   Hence the current setting to 1 is just buggy.

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/axboe/fio/commit/8ca8a05d92fa799fe93a6edc27b058802211fddc]
