Subject: [PATCH] test: use Ubuntu 22.04 for 64-bit tests

On 22.04 there was a conflict among libunwind-14-dev, libunwind-dev, and
libunwind8 that was resolved by removing libunwind-14-dev.

The 32-bit Ubuntu setup steps require more attention to get them to work
on 22.04. Stay on 20.04 for now and figure it out later.
