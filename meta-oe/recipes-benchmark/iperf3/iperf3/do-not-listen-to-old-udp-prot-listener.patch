Subject: [PATCH] Do not listen to old pro_listener

Clear old UDP prot_listener from read_set, as currently the server's select()
always return when data (that is relevant only to the worker thread) is
received. This makes the main thread consume a lot of unnecessary CPU, which
reduces the total throughput - especially when only one stream is used.

In my single machine environment, with the this fix the throughput is
increased by about 40% for one stream test.
