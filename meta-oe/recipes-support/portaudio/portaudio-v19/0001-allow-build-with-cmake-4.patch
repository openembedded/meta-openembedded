Subject: [PATCH] cmake: Set minimum required version to 3.5 for CMake 4+
 compatibility

Fix:

| CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
|   Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.
|
|   Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
|   to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
|   to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
|
|   Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.
|
|
| -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio/commit/ccd16c85e64d8c1a5462541388b6fbcaedbb1cad]
