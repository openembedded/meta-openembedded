Subject: [PATCH] webkitgtk3: add recipe

Injection a year based on the current date isn't reproducible. Hack this
to a specific year for now for reproducibilty and to avoid autobuilder failures.

The correct fix would be to use SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from the environment and
then this could be submitted upstream, sadly my ruby isn't up to that.

Upstream-Status: Pending [could be reworked]
