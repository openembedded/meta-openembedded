Subject: [PATCH] cmake: Do not add -msse4.2 -mpclmul on clang

When testcase is compiled with clang and -msse4.2 -mpclmul is added to
cxxflags then clang -m32 still ends up compiling the test case which is
not correct for i386, therefore depend on yocto to pass the right flags
from environemnt via cflags rather than manufecture them here

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE-Specific]
