Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Reject extraneous data after SSL or GSS encryption
 handshake.

The server collects up to a bufferload of data whenever it reads data
from the client socket.  When SSL or GSS encryption is requested
during startup, any additional data received with the initial
request message remained in the buffer, and would be treated as
already-decrypted data once the encryption handshake completed.
Thus, a man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the 
TCP connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of
a supposedly encryption-protected database session.

This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
although that would only work if the server did not demand any 
authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
authentication might well not do so.)

To fix, throw a protocol-violation error if the internal buffer
is not empty after the encryption handshake.

Our thanks to Jacob Champion for reporting this problem.
