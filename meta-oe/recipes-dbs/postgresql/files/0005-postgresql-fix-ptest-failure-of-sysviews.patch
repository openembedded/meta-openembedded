Subject: [PATCH 5/5] postgresql: fix ptest failure of sysviews

The patch "0001-config_info.c-not-expose-build-info.patch" hides the debug info
in pg_config table which reduces the count of rows from pg_config and leads to
sysviews test failure.
To fix it we need to reduce the count of parameters in sysviews test.
Also we need to reduce the row count in expected result of sysview test
to make the test output shown as pass.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe specific]
