# Linting

We use [oelint-adv](`https://github.com/priv-kweihmann/oelint-adv`)
as a linter to ensure consistent quality. You can lint your recipes
with the same linting rules with:

    oelint-adv --rulefile=oelint-rulefile.json --quiet <recipe>

This is using a sub-set of rules (no info-level rules). If you
want an even stricter linting omit the `--rulefile` argument.
