SUMMARY = "Visually render documentation for an API defined with the OpenAPI"
DESCRIPTION = "\
    Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and \
    interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. \
    It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, \
    with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption. \
